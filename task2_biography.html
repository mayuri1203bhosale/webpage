    <p>Prakash Baba Amte is a social worker from Maharashtra, India. Amte and his wife, Mandakini Amte, were awarded the Magsaysay Award for 'Community Leadership' in 2008 for their philanthropic work in the form of the Lok Biradari Prakalp amongst the Madia Gonds in the Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra and the neighboring states of Telangana and Madhya Pradesh. In November 2019 he was awarded with the ICMR Lifetime Achievement Award by Bill Gates.</p><br>
    
    <h3><b>Early Life</b></h3><hr><br>
    <p>Prakash Amte is the second son of Magsaysay awardee Baba Amte. He obtained a medical degree from Government Medical College (GMC), Nagpur, and he met his wife Mandakini during their post-graduation studies at Government Medical College (GMC), Nagpur. Prakash and Mandakini joined Baba Amte and helped her father and others overcome the taboo and fear of leprosy. When Prakash was studying M.S., the Government of Maharashtra granted land to Lok Biradari Prakalp (a social organisation founded by his father in 1973). Prakash left his study to take the legacy of his father of social work and moved to Hemalkasa along with his family.
Lok Biradari Prakalp includes a school, a hospital, and an animal orphanage. The institution works for the development of Madia Gond, situated in Hemalkasa. Amte lived there without electricity for almost 20 years and even executed some major emergency surgeries without electricity.</p><br>

<h3><b>Amte's Animal Ark</b></h3><hr>
<p> Amte's Animal Ark houses about 115 orphaned animals. Madia-Gond tribes weren't an agrarian community and would hunt for animals. It was to conserve animals that Lok Biradari Prakalp opened a rescue centre. The tribe still hunts for animals during the festivals and give young orphaned animals to the Ark. In exchange, they get rice, vegetables or clothing. The Ark also conducts "Save the snakes" campaign. Dr. Prakash Amte believes that everyone should be sensitive and loving towards all animals. That's why, the care animals receive in the Ark is unlike other zoos. As per the Central Zoo Authority, the organisation is required to increase the size of the enclosure and to maximise natural enrichment. The boundary walls are being constructed. 8 full time volunteers take care of these animals. They are vaccinated for rabies regularly. Closed circuit TVs (CCTV) are installed in each cage. During summertime, the cages are covered with green cloth. Also, coolers or fans are used to keep the temperature in control. During winter, grass or jute bags are used in cages to keep the animals warm. In cages with snakes, heaters are used. During the rainy season, the cages are covered with shades.</p><br>

<h3><b>Lok Biradari Prakalp</b></h3><hr>
    <p>In 1973, Amte moved to Hemalkasa to start the Lok Biradari Prakalp, a project for the development of tribal people, most of whom were the Madia Gond in the forests of Gadchiroli district. He lived and worked there for almost twenty years performing emergency surgical procedures without electricity. The project transformed into a hospital, Lok Biradari Prakalp Davakhana, a residential school, Lok Biradari Prakalp Ashram Shala, and an orphanage for injured wild animals, the Amte's Animal Park. The project provides health care to about 40,000 individuals annually. The Lok Biradari Prakalp Ashram School has over 600 students, residents and day scholars. Work of Amte's for Gond tribals and their philanthropic work in the form of the Lok Biradari Prakalp amongst the Madia Gonds in Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra and the neighboring states of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh also won them recognition. Dr. Prakash and his family also run a large animal conservation facility in Hemalkasa in Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra where rare, protected, and endangered animals are cared and have freedom to roam. The family's legacy in philanthropy and animal conservation is now carried over by their sons Digant and Aniket and their respective families who are helping their parents now.</p><br>
